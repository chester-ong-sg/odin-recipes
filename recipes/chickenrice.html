        <h2>Description:</h2>
         <p>Hainanese Chicken Rice is a beloved dish in Singapore and Malaysia, known for its fragrant rice, tender poached chicken, and flavorful sauces. The chicken is gently cooked to retain its juiciness, while the rice is prepared with chicken fat, garlic, and ginger for extra aroma. Served with chili sauce, ginger paste, and dark soy sauce, this dish is a staple in Southeast Asian cuisine.</p>
